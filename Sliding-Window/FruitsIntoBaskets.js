//Given an array of characters where each character represents a fruit tree, 
//you are given two baskets, and your goal is to put maximum number of fruits in each basket. 
//The only restriction is that each basket can have only one type of fruit.
//You can start with any tree, but you canâ€™t skip a tree once you have started. 
//You will pick one fruit from each tree until you cannot, i.e., you will stop when you have to pick from a third fruit type.
//Write a function to return the maximum number of fruits in both baskets.

//The problem is similar to Longest Substring with K Distinct Characters, where K=2
//We need to find a length of the longest subarray with no more than 2 distinct characters(fruit types)

//Time Complexity: O(N)
//N is the number of characters in the input array
//The outer for loop runs for all characters, and the inner while loop processes each character only once; 
//therefore, the time complexity of the algorithm will be O(N+N), 
//which is asymptotically equivalent to O(N).

//Space Complexity: O(1)
